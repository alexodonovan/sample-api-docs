# Sample REST API 
 
This project uses [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/). 
 
## Before you start 
 
To run this application in your local environment you will need 
 
* [Java 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or later 
* [Maven 3.3+](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) 
 
## Getting started 
 
The first step after checking out the project is to build the application. 
 
 
``` 
mvn clean install 
``` 
 
 
When the application has built successfully it can be started with: 
``` 
mvn spring-boot:run 
``` 
 
You can then check the swagger docs for the [REST API](http://localhost:8095/scd-api/swagger-ui.html)
